Examples/Emotional Learning
---------------------------

These are some representative experiments to be run with the amygdala,
hippocampus and OFC models. As the result of any conditioning experiment
depends on the exact schedule used, and, for these models, also on such things
as the location of each stimulus, there are a number of possible variations of
these. Thus do not take these experiments as gospel, but as some
representative testfiles to run the models on.

To run the examples, start Ikaros with the file test.ikc and specify the
experiment to run using the -b option at start up. The number after -b selects 
the experimenat from the list:

0: AcquisitionExtinction
1: Blocking
2: ConditionedInhibition
3: Discrimination
4: Disinhibition
5: Disinhibition2
6: Blocking
7: NegativePatterning
8: PositivePatterning
9: SFPD

For example, use the following to test blocking:

IKAROS -b1 test.ikc

There are old xml files in some of the directories that do not work anymore.
They are included for documentational puraposes.
